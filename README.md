#### :crystal_ball: Quote-Generator
:octocat: Online quote generator where you click a button and it gives you a random quote. Created with HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery.   
***
The idea for this project came from FreeCodeCamp, where the project is one of a total of 9 front-end development related projects. 
##### With this project, I learned to...   
– Use RGB colors to add an opacity-like effect to the quotes background without affecting the other elements.
– Use HTML and CSS classes in the JavaScript code to make them update in real time when the user clicks the buttons.   
– Use Math.floor() and Math.random() to randomize the quotes by length and show them randomly without following an order.
